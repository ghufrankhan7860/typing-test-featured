    "the morning begins with a quiet hush over the fields the soft light of dawn touches every blade of grass and the cool air is filled with the scent of dew and earth birds begin their songs from high branches welcoming the start of a new day the wind carries their melodies across the open land stirring the leaves and brushing over the still waters of the stream that winds gently through the valley a fox emerges from its den blinking against the soft brightness it moves cautiously placing each paw carefully on the damp ground nearby rabbits nibble on clover their ears twitching at every sound but they feel no fear here there is peace a quiet rhythm that binds everything together the river flows slowly pebbles glint under the clear water dragonflies hover above their wings catching the light and flashing like tiny mirrors across the surface wildflowers bloom in bursts of color scattered across the meadows reds yellows purples all nodding gently in the breeze in the distance a farmer walks his path through the fields his boots sinking slightly into the rich soil he carries a basket filled with tools a steady heartbeat of life and work unfolding as it always has the sky shifts from pale blue to gold as the sun climbs higher revealing the details of the world every branch every stone every whisper of wind in the grass becomes sharper more vivid animals stir in the forest squirrels leap from branch to branch their small claws scrabbling against bark deer step lightly through the underbrush their hooves barely making a sound everything is connected in a dance too ancient for words and yet felt deeply in the bones of those who take the time to notice it the world speaks not with voices but with motion with scent with the slow unfolding of light and shadow through the day as morning deepens the village begins to stir smoke rises from chimneys dogs bark in greeting children laugh as they chase each other down narrow lanes the baker opens his door releasing the warm rich smell of fresh bread into the air while the blacksmith hammers out a steady rhythm that rings like a heartbeat through the streets each sound each scent weaving together to form the fabric of the day none of it hurried none of it rushed everything moving at its own natural pace in harmony with the land even the clouds seem to drift with purpose casting slow moving shadows over the hills and fields bees buzz industriously from flower to flower gathering nectar with single minded determination their tiny bodies dusted with golden pollen in the gardens tomatoes hang heavy on the vine peas climb trellises reaching for the sun the earth gives generously and the people receive gratefully hands deep in the soil hearts full of quiet contentment the river continues its journey winding past the village past the fields slipping between rocks and trees always moving forward always singing its soft song travelers sometimes follow its course their footsteps blending with the rhythms of nature a reminder that paths made by water are often the truest and oldest ways to journey the fox from earlier returns to its den curling up in the cool shade to rest while overhead an eagle circles riding the thermals rising from the warming land its sharp eyes scanning the world below as midday approaches the air grows warmer cicadas begin their constant droning chorus filling the spaces between other sounds with their metallic music children retreat to the shade sipping cool water from clay pitchers the blacksmith wipes sweat from his brow setting aside his hammer for a brief rest while the baker dusts flour from his hands and leans in the doorway watching the world go by a cat stretches luxuriously on a sun warmed stone before settling in for a nap birds dart back and forth gathering food for their young who chirp hungrily from nests tucked away in the eaves of houses the farmer sits under a tree pulling a worn hat low over his eyes as he dozes briefly in the shade letting the steady pulse of the day wash over him without urgency or concern the fields ripple like a green sea under the touch of the breeze each blade of grass each stalk of wheat moving in unison as if breathing in and out with the earth itself and still the river flows still the clouds drift still the sun climbs slowly across the sky tracing its ancient arc above the world afternoon deepens and the colors of the world grow richer the greens of the fields deepen the blues of the sky intensify and the golds and browns of the earth glow under the warm light a group of children gather near the stream tossing pebbles into the water watching them skip and dance across the surface their laughter mixing with the bubbling of the current an old man fishes from the bank his line a thin thread connecting him to the unseen world beneath the surface dragonflies continue their dizzying ballet above the water the fox ventures out once more drawn by the cooling air and the changing scents of evening birds begin to call to one another in more urgent tones gathering in flocks preparing for the journey back to nests and roosts the sun dips lower shadows stretch longer the air grows cooler and carries the faint scent of woodsmoke as fires are lit in hearths and kitchens windows glow warmly against the encroaching dusk the baker pulls the last loaves from his oven setting them to cool on wooden racks the blacksmith hangs up his tools wiping his hands on a cloth before stepping into the evening light the farmer gathers his tools and walks home whistling a low tune to himself as he goes the river darkens its surface now reflecting the fiery colors of the sunset reds oranges purples swirling and shifting with the gentle current frogs begin to call from the banks their deep voices adding to the growing chorus of night sounds the fox finds a quiet spot near the river watching as bats flit through the twilight snatching insects from the air children are called inside doors close lights are extinguished and the village settles once more into quiet the last light fades from the sky and stars emerge blinking into existence one by one overhead the moon rises casting a silver path across the darkened land illuminating the river the fields the hills with a pale gentle light in the forest owls hoot softly to one another deer move cautiously through the underbrush and somewhere deep within the earth the slow patient roots of trees continue their unseen growth stretching deeper reaching outward the world turns and breathes and dreams the same as it has for countless generations all connected all moving all alive and those who walk the land with open eyes and open hearts can feel it can hear the silent music that weaves through everything like an invisible river pulling all things forward toward the dawn that will come again when the sun rises once more touching each blade of grass each branch each stone with light and warmth and the cycle begins anew";

export const punctuationText = `The city woke before the sun. Long before the first light touched the tops of the tallest skyscrapers, the streets were alive with motion. Buses rumbled along the main avenues, headlights cutting through the thin mist that drifted between buildings. Vendors pushed carts loaded with fresh bread, coffee, and flowers, their voices echoing off glass and stone. Pigeons flapped noisily as they searched for breakfast scraps. Newspapers landed with soft thuds on doorsteps, ready to deliver the world to a million waiting hands. In small apartments high above the streets, alarms buzzed and rang. People stirred in their beds, blinking against the early darkness. Coffee makers gurgled and hissed to life, sending rich aromas into kitchens barely touched by the morning light. Showers splashed, closets opened and closed, and shoes clicked across hardwood floors. Children yawned and stretched under warm blankets, reluctant to leave the comfort of dreams behind. By six o'clock, the sidewalks were packed. Men in suits hurried toward subway entrances, checking watches and phones. Teenagers with backpacks slung over one shoulder loitered near bus stops, trading jokes and music. A woman in a bright yellow coat balanced a laptop bag and a hot cup of coffee, expertly weaving through the growing crowd. Delivery drivers double-parked, leaving packages in tidy piles at the entrances of tall office towers. Above it all, the sky blushed pink, the first shy sign of the coming sun. Traffic thickened. Horns blared. Crosswalks flooded with people during each green signal and emptied just as quickly when the lights changed. Food trucks opened their windows, sending out tempting smells of bacon, eggs, and fresh bagels. A construction crew clattered and shouted as they set up barriers around a massive new project site. By eight o'clock, the city was in full motion. Coffee shops buzzed with customers. Laptops opened. Meetings started. In offices twenty, thirty, even fifty stories up, windows lit up with the glow of monitors and the buzz of conversation. Elevators hummed and chimed. Somewhere, a new business launched. Elsewhere, an old one closed its doors for the last time. Opportunity and risk moved side by side, as they always had. In the parks, early joggers shared trails with dog walkers and yoga groups. The leaves of towering trees whispered with the softest breeze. Children climbed jungle gyms, shrieking with laughter, while their parents sipped coffee and checked their phones. An artist set up an easel near the pond, brush poised, capturing the delicate light filtering through the trees. As the sun rose higher, glass buildings turned into mirrors, reflecting the life below. Taxi cabs painted streaks of yellow across the busy streets. Cyclists dodged around cars and pedestrians with the practiced skill of seasoned warriors. Music spilled from open windows, mixing jazz, pop, and distant church bells into one chaotic, living song. Lunch hour came like a tidal wave. Office workers poured into the streets, searching for tacos, salads, pizzas, and noodles. Food stalls sent smoke curling into the air. Groups gathered at shaded tables, laughing and gossiping between bites. A street musician played a sweet, mournful tune on a saxophone, his case open at his feet. People tossed in bills and coins without breaking stride. Tourists wandered with cameras swinging around their necks, snapping pictures of statues, murals, and each other. Street performers drew crowds—magicians with clever hands, dancers moving like water, poets shouting their words to the sky. A woman in a red dress sang opera beneath a towering archway, her voice soaring over the noise. By mid-afternoon, the sun burned hot against the sidewalks. Ice cream trucks rolled out, bells chiming, and kids ran laughing after them. Dogs panted in the shade. Vendors handed out cold water bottles to grateful customers. In the financial district, serious men and women in sharp suits paced along phone calls that decided futures. In the arts district, painters splashed color across vast canvases, sculptors chipped away at stone, and dancers rehearsed steps over and over in sun-drenched studios. Everywhere, ambition pulsed through the veins of the city like blood. As the day leaned toward evening, the light softened. Long shadows stretched across the sidewalks. Restaurants opened their doors wide, letting the smell of roasted meats, garlic, spices, and wine spill out onto the streets. People laughed and leaned close over tiny tables packed together on patios. Musicians set up on corners and plazas, tuning guitars, adjusting mics, tapping rhythms on tabletops. The city began to glow. Lights blinked on, one by one, in every window. Headlights painted rivers of white and red down the avenues. Billboards lit up with flashing ads. Neon signs buzzed and flickered, casting colorful halos on the pavement below. Rush hour hit like a hammer. Trains groaned under the weight of packed commuters. Buses lurched from stop to stop, taking on and letting off crowds with every swing of the doors. Taxis honked impatiently. Pedestrians swarmed the crosswalks, umbrellas popping open at the first hint of rain. By seven o'clock, the theaters filled. Velvet curtains parted. Spotlights flared. Orchestras tuned. Plays, concerts, ballets, and comedy shows spilled their magic into the night. On rooftops, parties bloomed under strings of fairy lights. On riverbanks, couples walked hand in hand, their voices soft against the gurgling water. The deeper the night grew, the more the city shifted. Suits gave way to glittering dresses and polished shoes. Nightclubs opened their doors, bass beats pounding through the streets. Bars filled with laughter, arguments, clinking glasses, and the low hum of flirtation. At midnight, the city was still alive. Taxi drivers leaned out windows, calling for fares. Food vendors sold hot dogs, tacos, and kebabs to late-night wanderers. Street sweepers rolled through, gathering the day's debris. In tiny apartments, lights clicked off one by one. Someone wrote the last sentence of a novel. Someone else started a new song. Dreams began and ended with every heartbeat of the city. In the smallest hours of the morning, the city rested—but only lightly. A few souls still wandered the streets: bakers preparing dough, security guards pacing lonely lobbies, insomniacs staring from windows at the quiet world outside. The city breathed slowly, softly, waiting. And then, just as the night began to loosen its hold, a thin pale light touched the tops of the tallest skyscrapers once more. Alarms buzzed. Coffee makers sputtered. Doors opened. Shoes clicked across floors. The city woke again, ready to live another day.`;

i had packed my bag the night before with 2 sets of clothes 1 camera 1 notebook and a handful of maps tucked into the side pocket my first destination was a small town located 120 kilometers away and the train was scheduled to leave at 630 sharp the station buzzed with sleepy energy vendors selling coffee for 3 coins per cup workers pulling heavy suitcases behind them and announcements blaring every 10 minutes or so i boarded the train and found my seat next to a window the view outside blurred into a streak of green and brown as we moved faster and faster i jotted down notes every 15 minutes to record my thoughts by the time we reached the first stop i had written almost 4 pages when we arrived at the town around 845 i stepped onto the platform stretching my legs and breathing in the fresh morning air i had 6 hours to explore before my next connection so i rented a bicycle for 20 coins and set off toward the hills the road climbed steadily for about 8 kilometers winding through farms and small villages the air was crisp and the sky had turned a brilliant blue cows grazed lazily by the roadside and i waved at 2 young boys flying a red and blue kite near a crumbling stone wall after 45 minutes of cycling i reached a clearing with a spectacular view rolling hills stretching as far as the eye could see a river glinting silver in the distance and patches of golden fields laid out like a patchwork quilt i sat there for 30 minutes eating a sandwich i had bought for 5 coins from a smiling woman at the station and sipping water from my flask by noon the sun was high overhead and i made my way back to the town center i had 90 minutes left before my next train and decided to visit the local market it was bursting with color and sound spices fruits textiles and pottery crammed into stalls lining the cobblestone streets i bought a small woven bracelet for 7 coins and 2 ripe mangoes for 4 coins each at exactly 215 the next train rolled into the station and i boarded feeling pleasantly tired the ride to the capital city took about 3 hours giving me plenty of time to nap and watch the changing landscape fields forests rivers towns flashing past like a living tapestry when we arrived the city was alive with energy the sidewalks crammed with people cars taxis buses weaving chaotic patterns through the wide avenues neon signs blinking even though it was still daylight i found a small guesthouse 2 streets away from the main square a cozy place for 25 coins a night with a creaky bed and a window overlooking a bustling street after dropping off my backpack i ventured out camera slung around my neck snapping photos every few steps fountains statues street musicians every 5 meters there was something worth capturing i climbed 243 steps to reach the top of the old cathedral and the view took my breath away a sea of red roofs golden domes and narrow alleys stretching in every direction as the sun dipped lower i made my way to the riverfront where food stalls sold everything from roasted corn 6 coins to spicy kebabs 10 coins and sugar dusted pastries 3 coins i chose a platter of grilled fish and vegetables for 15 coins and sat by the water watching boats drift lazily past locals and tourists mingling on the stone walkways a band played lively music nearby drawing a small crowd that clapped along in rhythm by 10 in the evening the city took on a magical glow strings of lights crisscrossed the alleys lanterns bobbed gently from second story windows and laughter echoed from busy cafes i wandered through the night market where stalls sold handmade leather bags for 40 coins embroidered scarves for 18 coins and delicate silver rings for 22 coins i bought a small journal for 5 coins intending to fill it with stories from my journey the next morning i was up at 7 sharp after a quick breakfast of bread and cheese from a vendor for 6 coins i boarded a bus heading north the driver announced the journey would take approximately 5 hours covering a distance of 300 kilometers the bus wound its way through mountains valleys and sleepy towns i dozed off and on snapping awake every 30 minutes to admire a particularly beautiful stretch of countryside or a cluster of colorful houses perched on a hillside we stopped twice once at a roadside cafe where coffee cost 2 coins and then again at a scenic overlook where everyone rushed to take photos i climbed a short trail about 500 meters leading to a small shrine where prayer flags fluttered wildly in the wind the view was worth every step a deep blue lake cradled by steep cliffs and forests glowing green under the midday sun by the time we reached our destination it was 130 in the afternoon i checked into a guesthouse run by an elderly couple who charged 20 coins for a cozy room with a carved wooden balcony overlooking the town square bells chimed every hour on the hour and i spent the afternoon wandering through twisting streets past houses painted in shades of turquoise yellow and coral i met a group of fellow travelers from 3 different countries and we decided to hike together the next day setting off at 6 in the morning our goal was to reach a remote monastery perched 1800 meters above the valley floor the hike was grueling steep trails loose rocks and sharp winds but we encouraged each other every step of the way stopping for water breaks every 45 minutes and sharing snacks of dried fruit and nuts by midday we reached the monastery and were rewarded with breathtaking views prayer wheels spun lazily in the wind and monks welcomed us with bowls of butter tea the journey back down took another 2 hours and by the time we reached the town we were dusty sweaty and exhilarated we celebrated with plates of steaming dumplings 12 coins per plate and cups of sweet chai 3 coins each sitting under a thatched roof as the sun set behind the mountains the night air was cool and crisp and laughter rang out across the square from every tavern and cafe over the next 7 days i traveled through villages climbed hills wandered markets crossed rivers slept under the stars and filled every page of my new journal with memories each experience marked by the number of steps taken the coins exchanged the kilometers traveled the hours passed but also by the intangible moments the smiles the songs the silent awe at a sunrise or a starlit sky somewhere along the way i realized the journey was not about the numbers at all but about the spaces between them the stories that could not be measured the emotions that refused to be counted and so i continued onward through dusty towns rainy mornings golden afternoons snowy peaks and bustling ports each new day another chapter another chance to lose and find myself once again`;

export const paragraphText = `The year was 2497. Humanity had spread across more than 42 planets in 5 different star systems, and Earth, once the center of civilization, had become just another colony in the vastness of space. Captain Aria Mendez stood on the bridge of the exploration vessel Valkyrie-7, her gaze locked on the swirling nebula displayed across the main viewing screen. "Coordinates set for Sector 19," reported Lieutenant Harris, his fingers dancing across the control panel. "Estimated arrival in 3 hours and 15 minutes." "Engage the drive," Aria ordered. With a soft hum, the quantum engines powered up. Within seconds, the ship lurched into faster-than-light travel, covering distances measured in millions of kilometers almost instantly. The mission was simple on paper: survey 6 newly discovered exoplanets, establish communication relays, and search for any signs of intelligent life. In reality, it was far more complicated. The last 2 expeditions sent to this sector had vanished without a trace. "Life support systems stable," confirmed Ensign Vale. "Oxygen levels at 99.8%, all internal temperatures holding at 22 degrees Celsius." "Good," Aria said. "Let's hope it stays that way." At precisely 1545 ship time, Valkyrie-7 exited warp and dropped into normal space. Before them loomed a massive gas giant, designated XG-113. It had 12 moons, 4 of which showed potential for hosting life. "Scanning moons," Vale said. "One moment... Moon 3 shows unusual atmospheric readings. High concentrations of oxygen and nitrogen. Surface temperatures averaging 17 degrees Celsius." "Plot a course," Aria instructed. "Bring us into orbit." The ship descended toward the moon, thrusters firing in controlled bursts. As they approached, the planet's surface became clearer: vast oceans covering nearly 70% of the landscape, with green and gold continents stretching between them. "Receiving a signal," Harris said, eyebrows raised. "Weak but consistent. Repeating every 42 seconds." "Put it on speakers." A soft series of tones echoed through the bridge—6 notes, repeating, over and over. "It could be natural," Vale suggested. "Or it could be artificial," Aria countered. "Prepare a landing party. Standard exploration gear. 4 personnel. We touch down in 20 minutes." Gear loaded, suits checked, weapons charged, the team gathered in the shuttle bay. Aria led, flanked by Harris, Vale, and Dr. Lin—the ship's chief biologist. Their shuttle, Falcon-3, detached from Valkyrie-7 with a hiss of compressed gas, descending rapidly toward the surface. The shuttle touched down on a smooth plain near the coastline. Wind speeds were moderate at 23 kilometers per hour, and the gravity was 0.92g—slightly lighter than Earth but comfortable. Stepping onto the alien world, Aria felt a thrill race through her. New worlds were rare prizes. The signal was stronger here, repeating every 42 seconds without fail. The team moved cautiously, instruments scanning the surroundings. Temperature held steady at 18 degrees Celsius; radiation levels were minimal. They had traveled only 600 meters from the shuttle when they found it. A structure. Not natural. Tall, metallic, smooth as glass, and humming faintly with energy. A tower, perhaps 25 meters tall, pulsing softly with each cycle of the signal. "What do you make of it?" Aria asked. Dr. Lin approached carefully, scanners active. "Material composition unknown. 87% similarity to titanium alloy, but with embedded elements we have never cataloged." Harris circled the structure, noting glyphs—dozens of them—etched into the surface in neat, swirling patterns. "This is not just a random object," Harris said. "Someone built this." The team set up temporary equipment: atmospheric readers, environmental analyzers, comm relays. It took exactly 2 hours and 37 minutes to establish a secured perimeter. As the sun dipped below the horizon—revealing 2 smaller moons rising in the alien sky—the tower changed. The humming intensified, and a beam of blue light shot skyward from its apex. A new signal broadcast. This time, not 6 tones, but 8. Vale recorded the entire event, noting the pattern repeated every 58 seconds now. "We need to get this data back to the ship," Aria decided. The trip back to Valkyrie-7 was tense. Every shadow seemed deeper. Every sound sharper. Back aboard the ship, analysis began immediately. "It could be a beacon," Dr. Lin theorized. "Or a warning." Over the next 4 days, they monitored the surface from orbit. On the third night, they detected movement: 5 large shapes emerging from the forests, heading toward the tower. The creatures were massive—4-legged, armored, almost reptilian. Each one stood nearly 6 meters tall. "They seem to be drawn to the tower," Harris observed. "And what happens when they get there?" Aria wondered aloud. They soon found out. At exactly 0300 ship time, the creatures gathered around the base of the tower. For 7 minutes, they remained motionless. Then the tower pulsed once, a deep resonance that shook the ground even from orbit. In response, the creatures began to glow faintly, patterns of light coursing across their armored hides. "They're communicating," Lin whispered. Within minutes, the creatures dispersed, heading back into the forests. Aria made a decision. They needed to understand the tower fully. Not just observe. A second landing party formed—this time with additional security personnel. They brought more equipment, including heavy sensors capable of detecting subatomic shifts. Near the base of the tower, Vale found a hatch. "Looks mechanical," he said. "Manual override possible. Estimated force required: 12 kilonewtons." "Can we open it without damaging it?" Aria asked. "Yes, using the plasma cutters. It'll take about 23 minutes." Permission granted, the team set to work. At minute 17, the hatch slid open on its own. Lights blinked from within—red, green, blue, pulsing in a rhythmic sequence. They descended a spiral ramp, each step illuminated automatically. The interior was vast, at least 4 stories deep. Panels lined the walls, covered in the same glyphs they had seen outside. At the center of the chamber, a large sphere floated—no visible supports—humming quietly. Dr. Lin approached with her scanners. "This sphere is generating the signal," she said. "Its surface temperature is 25.4 degrees Celsius." Suddenly, the sphere shifted, projecting a hologram into the air above it. Images flashed rapidly: star systems, planets, unfamiliar creatures, cities of glass and stone. "It's a database," Harris guessed. "A record." Vale adjusted his scanner. "I detect 9 major categories within the holographic interface. If we can translate even 1 of them, it could take decades to study it all." They recorded everything. Hours turned into days. Back aboard Valkyrie-7, the ship's AI, SIGMA-9, assisted with translation efforts. Patterns emerged: the builders of the tower called themselves the Xylari. They had inhabited this system for thousands of years before vanishing. The towers—there were 512 scattered across 5 planets—acted as archives of their civilization. But not all records were benign. Warnings existed. Mentions of an ancient enemy. A force that had wiped out entire star systems. Designation: Entity-0. The last entries were desperate, fragmented. Dates correlated to nearly 23000 years ago. The Xylari had fought, and lost. Aria stared at the data, heart pounding. Had the Entity-0 survived? Was it still out there? Or worse—was it coming back? The crew held a meeting at 0700 the next day. Options were few. They could continue surveying the towers, or they could report back to Command immediately. After intense debate, the decision was made. They would split the team: half would stay to continue gathering data; the rest would return to the nearest relay station, 2 jumps away, and deliver the information. It would take 18 hours to reach the station. They departed at 0900 sharp. The journey was tense. Every fluctuation on the sensors, every distortion in the warp field, set nerves on edge. But they arrived safely. The data was transmitted using a Level-5 priority signal, encrypted 3 times over. Command acknowledged receipt 7 minutes later. A response would come in 12 hours. Back near XG-113, Valkyrie-7 continued its studies. Three more towers were found. Each revealed more information, more warnings. And one terrifying truth: Entity-0 had not been destroyed. It had merely slept. Now, as the systems near XG-113 buzzed with new activity, the signs pointed to one chilling possibility. It was waking up.`;
